          Super Mario is a series of platform games created by Nintendo, and
          featuring their mascot, Mario.Alternatively called the Super Mario
          Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of
          the greater Mario franchise.Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario while
          developing Donkey Kong in an attempt to produce a best-selling video
          game for Nintendo; previous titles like Sheriff had not achieved the
          same success as titles like Pac-Man. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to
          create a video game that used the characters Popeye, Bluto, and Olive
          Oyl.[3] At the time, however, Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license
          to use the characters (and would not until 1982 with Popeye), so he
          ended up making an unnamed player character, Donkey Kong, and Lady
          (later known as Pauline).[3] In the early stages of Donkey Kong, Mario
          was unable to jump, and the focus was to escape a maze. However,
          Miyamoto enabled Mario to jump, saying "If you had a barrel rolling
          towards you, what would you do?

        While the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release, he was named
        Jumpman in the game's English instructions[6] and Mario in the sales
        brochure.[7] Miyamoto originally named the character "Mr. Video", and he
        was to be used in every video game Miyamoto developed
